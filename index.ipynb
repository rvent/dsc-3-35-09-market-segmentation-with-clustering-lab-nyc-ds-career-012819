    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll use our knowledge of clustering to perform market segmentation on a real-world dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify and explain what Market Segmentation is, and how clustering can be used for segmentation\n",
    "* Use clustering algorithms to create and interpret a market segmentation on real-world data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we're going to work with the [Wholesale Customers Dataset] from the UCI Machine Learning Datasets Respository.

Overall, the quality of the clustering algorithm did alot better than the first algorithm we ran on unscaled data. The best performance was achieved when reducing the number of Principal Components down to 4. The increase in model performance is likely due to the reduction in dimensionality. Although dropping the last 2 PCs means that we lose about 6% of our explained variance, this proved to be a net-positive tradeoff for the reduction in dimensionality it provided. "
